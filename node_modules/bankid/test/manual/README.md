### Manual tests for the BankId library

First, follow the instructions [here](https://www.bankid.com/assets/bankid/rp/how-to-get-bankid-for-test-v1.7.pdf) to get a test BankId.
When you have created a test identity (at https://demo.bankid.com/), and downloaded the test app, you can run:

```
yarn test <fill_in_mobile_device_ip> <fill_in_test_personal_number>
```

to go through a manual testing cycle of the library.
